# Introduction

Welcome to **Tung Playground** - a comprehensive framework for generating AI heroes from images and training them in physics simulators using reinforcement learning.

## What is Tung Playground?

Tung Playground implements a complete AIGC (AI-Generated Content) pipeline that transforms a single character image into a fully-trained, locomotion-capable agent in a physics simulation environment.

### Complete Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input Image] --> B[3D Generation]
    B --> C[Part Decomposition]
    C --> D[Skeleton Rigging]
    D --> E[URDF Creation]
    E --> F[Simulation Setup]
    F --> G[RL Training]
    G --> H[Trained Agent]
```

The framework processes your hero through six distinct stages:

1. **üñºÔ∏è Image-to-3D Generation**: Convert 2D character images to 3D meshes using state-of-the-art AI models
2. **üß© Part Decomposition**: Intelligently segment the 3D mesh into semantic body parts
3. **ü¶¥ Skeleton Rigging**: Generate an articulated skeleton with proper joint hierarchies
4. **ü§ñ URDF Generation**: Create physics-ready robot descriptions with mass, inertia, and collision properties
5. **üåç Simulation Setup**: Deploy the character in MuJoCo or Isaac Lab environments
6. **üß† RL Training**: Train locomotion policies using reinforcement learning algorithms

## Quick Example

Here's how simple it is to create and train a hero:

```python
import tung_playground as tp

# Create a hero from an image
hero = tp.create_hero("my_character", "character.png")

# Set up the complete pipeline
pipeline = tp.create_pipeline()
pipeline.add_stages([
    tp.MeshyGenerator("generation"),
    tp.PartCrafterDecomposer("decomposition"),
    tp.AutoRigger("rigging"),
    tp.URDFBuilder("urdf"),
    tp.MuJoCoAdapter("simulation"),
    tp.PPOTrainer("training")
])

# Execute the full pipeline
results = await pipeline.execute(hero)

# Your hero is now ready for action!
print(f"Hero {hero.name} is ready with policy at {hero.assets.trained_policy}")
```
